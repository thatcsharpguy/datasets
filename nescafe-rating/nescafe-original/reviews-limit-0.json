Nescafe have just changed their faultless coffee to be 'double filtered' with the new red lid and it is absolutely disgusting! I cannot drink it! Never one to waste money but actually had to throw a jar away because no one wanted it! Awful move of Nescafe! In my social circle alone I know of four or five families who are now switching brands.  Sorry Nescafe.... you've lost me as a customer certainly and I'm sure there will be a few to follow!  Bring back your decent Nescafe original!",

I also assumed that it was just a new jar colour.  Wrong!  When I got home and compared the red one with my old brown jar, I saw that the brown top one is described as \"Classic\" whereas the red top is \"Original\".  Well, it might have been an 'origina'l recipe at one point, but there is no way it tastes anything like the Classic one I have enjoyed for over 30 years.  Not impressed, Nescafe, I feel that I have been conned!  This red top stuff tastes like it contains chicory.. won't be buying it again.",

It has completely lost it's rich, full bodied coffee flavour and become tasteless & bitter with a burnt smell and taste. The double filtering has filtered out all the good stuff and left us with something that, to my pallet (& I love a good coffee) is now undrinkable.  I had hoped that my 1st Jar was just a bad batch but having tasted a second jar I have today returned it to the place of purchase and got my money back. I've been drinking it for 50 years but I'll not be buying it ever again.   Unfortunalty it wouldn't let me give a rating of less than 1 star. Please Please bring back the Brown Top",

You can hide behind the 'Oh, of course people will complain whenever change occurs' card as much as you like, but you won't stop the unprecedented dislike of your replacement original flavour.  You could of course let the customers do the talking, by once again making the original flavour available, but I suspect  acknowledging you have made a mistake in public will be a step too far.",

I have been drinking Nescaf\u00e9 original since the late 50s when it was sold in tins and was a power.\r\nA natural choice because my grandfather worked for nestles in Aylesbury for 52 years and bought starff sales. Last week I bought the New improved \"original\" poured half of a 300gram jar into a coffee container and sniffed.\r\nNo smell of coffee just a mild nondescript not very pleasant smell.\r\nWhat have you done to my coffee to detract any aroma and taste from it.\r\nI thought it was me getting old until my wife tried it and accused me of buying some cheap brown granules from somewhere.\r\nCan you please tell me where can I buy some original NOT improved Nescaf\u00e9 that actually tastes like it comes from coffee beans?",

I take my Nescafe with me everywhere even on holiday. I am very disappointed with the new product it leaves a nasty taste in your mouth. Why change it? I wont be buying Nescafe again its dreadful.",

Luckily I managed to track down a normal jar as I did not like the flavour at all and will not be drinking it.  I have drank Nescafe Original for the best part of my coffee drinking life and now I am desperate to find another coffee as that is pretty much all I drink, about 10 cups a day.  Why change something that worked and after looking at all of the latest reviews I am obviously not the only one who thinks that way as all are negative.  Are you going to bring the other one back?  Please do, but in the mean time I have no alternative to change brands and hope to find a decent coffee.  If any old original drinkers have found a good alternative please share with me, thanks",

I have always tried to be the first one to break the seal on a new jar because I just loved that burst of aroma that comes with it, now that has been ruined it's just not the same any more.",

It might fit American taste but we in the UK like a stronger flavour. Hopefully, like Coca-Cola when they altered 'coke' and found consumers didn't like it, you will go back to the 'Original'.  I might point out also that 'New improved original' is an oxymoron too.\r\nFor the moment - I'll be looking for another brand.",

The feedback we received in consumer research was that this results in making Nescaf\u00e9 Original a more enjoyable cup of coffee.\n\nAny changes to our products are the result of rigorous research and development as we believe in producing products with a great taste, consistent levels of quality and safety, value for money and convenience.\n\nWe always value feedback from our consumers and this is particularly important when loyal consumers comment on any changes we have made. We were sorry to hear of your disappointment with the recent changes we\u2019ve made to Nescaf\u00e9 Original and we will pass your comments to the brand team who take on board all the feedback they receive for future product development.\n\nThank you once again for taking the trouble to contact us. We hope that in future you will enjoy our products.\n\nKind regards\n\nTom - NESCAF\u00c9 Team\n",

It disappeared from my main online supplier then returned to it but more expensive.So, I eventually bought several jars from another one. I wondered what had happened to the taste. I now see it is \"New Improved\". Well it is half as strong as before and tastes nothing like the original. I might as well buy a cheaper coffee, different brand. I am very annoyed you have changed the coffee to taste just the same as weaker so called \"smoother\" coffees. They in fact now taste better than Nescafe.",

He says the 'new improved' version is, and I quote, \"revolting and tastes like decaffeinated\".  He had not seen the new jar with the red lid (I had emptied it into our own container) so other than the taste he had no idea that the old brown lidded version had changed until he drank his first cup.  Off now to probably spend a small fortune trying to find a replacement that matches up to the original Original",

It's so full of flavour, whether made with water or milk, that I don't need to stock up on any other brands. I do tend to keep several of the sachet flavours at home (cappuccino,latte, creme caramel etc), mainly for visitors, but the sheer simplicity of making this fine tasting coffee means I don't use them that often. Although, I do admit to taking on a gold blend every now and again.  NESCAF\u00c9 original has a great taste, it's a full flavour ground coffee and it doesn't fail to deliver on taste.",

For me it is my morning coffee and only Nescaf\u00e9 Original. It wakes up all my senses...the aroma, the reassuringly pleasant taste, the velvety sensation as I stir it through hot water in my mug, that little bit of steam rising off the top is a welcome sight every day and the way it makes me sigh after the first sip. I may be missing out on other Nescaf\u00e9 coffees...perhaps...but I won't change and cannot be tempted when the original in my opinion is already as good as it gets! Pop the kettle on....",

I have now changed brands and I will not be purchasing the new inferior double filter ever again. I feel that a more constructive feedback from Nescafe istead of the generic one below would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nHi, we\u2019re always looking for ways to improve your experience with our coffee and that\u2019s why we decided to try & make this a more enjoyable cup for you! We\u2019re really sorry to hear how much you didn\u2019t enjoy our new Nescaf\u00e9 Original but really appreciate your feedback. We\u2019ve made a note of all your comments & will be passing them on to the rest of the team.",

I like the aroma which is really pleasant and rich and made me smile and also the taste is very smooth.\r\n\r\nValue for money - you do pay a bit more than the other brands but you do get high quality coffee.  I did buy my coffee when it was on offer but would be happy to continue buying Nescafe at the rrp price.\r\n\r\nI would rinse my mug/cup with boiling water to warm up, add coffee and then pour water that has just come of the boil. To me it seems to taste better than when you pour boiling water straight away (just tastes different).",

Tastes like \"fancy filtered de-caf\" with no 'bite'at all. Luckily, we've found a couple of shops that still stock the old stuff, so we're buying as many as we can, to last as long as we can, but we won't be buying 'new' Nescafe again. We'll have to find another Brand with a similar flavour.",

Perhaps another example of changing something for the sake of it.  It does smell the same but I'm not convinced and a bit disappointed. Also I really do not like the red lid. It is very cheap looking - brown was much better - only my opinion though.",
