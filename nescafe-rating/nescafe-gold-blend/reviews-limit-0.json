I've drunk almost nothing else but gold blend for half a lifetime, but suddenly someone has negated one of the best things about a quality instant coffee, in that you can drain the cup completely. This is no longer the case & I now have to beware of getting a mouthful of 'grits' like it's a pretend \"real\" coffee. If I'm going to have to put up with this, I might as well fill the machine & make a pot of fresh coffee anyway.. Would have been a lot better if you had introduced this as a new alternative product, rather than a replacement of your best-known brand with something inferior..",

Please change it back so we can enjoy and your product again or lose so many loyal customers.

Yes, it has always been expensive but what cost for good coffee, even after starting a family and money was tight we always had Gold Blend.\r\nThe taste and flavour is now thin, cheap and bitter, I suggest the name is changed to Gold Bland.\r\nWe will buy Gold Blend again if the recipe reverts to the original, until then, we will be trying other manufacturers coffee to see if anyone is producing one that is close to our preferred taste.\r\nDevastated to have to say \u201cgoodbye Gold Blend and goodbye Nescafe\u201d",

You have now completely ruined things. It's a very unsettling feeling to e.g. walk back into the house and realise you can no longer enjoy a good cup of coffee.

We're really disappointed to hear you are not enjoying it, however we have added roast and ground coffee ground 10 times finer to give it a more intense aroma whilst maintaining the same smoothness.

For the past few months I have been buying refill packs and recently thought I must have purchased a 'rogue' pack as I didn't experience the lovely aroma when opening the pack, the coffee tasted bland and I was left with grit/powder at the bottom of the mug. Earlier today a friend and fellow (former) Gold Blend fan told me she has stopped buying it as she has been so disappointed with changes made to the product. I decided to search \"what has happened to Gold Blend\" and have come across all these negative reviews. Please bring back the coffee we all love.\r\nIf it ain't broke, don't fix it!!",

Went to buy a new jar recently and was confused b y new packaging but thought it must be the same coffee.. how wrong! Opening the jar there was no aroma like there used to be and it just did not taste the same, it is bitter and leaves a strange taste in the mouth, have tried adding more sugar to no avail. So today i decided to google \u2018changes to Gold Blend\u2019 and i discover similar reviews to mine.. your new packaging does not advise changes have been made and i am deeply disappointed in you. Welcome your comments to my review",

Notice I say WAS.\r\nIt was all of this until you changed the recipe - now it's just bland, tasteless and there's nasty gritty stuff at the bottom of the cup.\r\nWhat were you thinking.

Now however there is no other way of putting it, it is terrible!  Black muck at the bottom of the cup, so weak that it doesn't even taste like coffee.  The only thing I can do is swap brands to something else unless you have the good sense and change it back to how it was.  I am not alone in the above opinion I have seen on several forums and social media sites ex-gold blend customers stating the same!!",

Your new blend smells different, tastes different and leaves residue at the bottom of the cup. I have heard that you are trying to give it a more 'Barista' style - but why/ You already make Nescafe Barista..so if people actually want Barista style, they will pick one of your other brands. Sadly, as you do not have any other type of coffee, that tastes as smooth and mild as the 'original' Nescafe Gold Blend, I will have to find another brand. This will be very hard, as I have tried almost all of the other brands and types and nothing has come close to the taste of the original Gold Blend..... But, sadly, you leave me no choice.",

The change of jar shape doesn\u2019t really bother me but it definitely doesn\u2019t stand out as much as before as it just looks like all the other jars now. The coffee tastes much weaker than the original but the biggest change is the dregs left in bottom of the mug. Sorry but not nice at all. I\u2019ll persevere til the end of the jar but at present am not convinced I\u2019ll keep buying it.",

I drink a lot of coffee and used to buy Gold Blend at home and at work as I liked the taste and preferred to pay for something I enjoyed than a cheaper substitute.  I will not buy another jar of the new Gold Blend though. If I wanted a Barista style coffee I'd buy one! Don't like the new taste and can't stand the sludge it leaves in the bottom of my mug.  I'm surprised that someone decided to change the very popular instant to one with ground coffee added as you already market this kind of alternative with the Azera line. Is it wrong to want a simple but good quality instant coffee. I am now looking for an alternative brand that suits my taste",

But recently we all noticed something wrong with the bitter aftertaste and mud at the bottom of our mugs.  And for me I'm convinced this is giving me a stomach ache.  OK Gold Blend was never really a premium coffee but it's always been very drinkable - but not now.  So please revert it to its old recipe and make my stomach feel good again.  In the meantime I shall start drinking the firm's tea!\r\nBTW it seems as though they've changed Black Gold (my favourite coffee at home for many years) so I guess I shall be changing to some other brand at home now.",

I have just purchased it in the new jar and found it doesn\u2019t taste anything like the original. It leaves a residue at the bottom of the cup and has a powdery taste. I have seen the other comments and the replies from the company saying it gives a barista style coffee. If I wanted to drink that style of coffee I would buy a tin of Azera. Please can you go back to the old recipe-or I will look for an alternative brand.",

There's nothing wrong with your coffee though :) We've added micro ground coffee to the recipe, to give it a more well rounded taste. This coffee is non-soluble and gives you a similar experience to that of a barista made coffee!

When I first saw the strange, discoloured sludge at the bottom of my cup I thought I hadn't stirred it properly but it just kept happening. Why oh why oh why do big brands have to faff about with a recipe that has been successful for years? Don't you know by now that \"New and Improved\" never is.\r\nPLEASE change it back or I will have to switch to a new coffee, and I have been drinking Gold Blend for years so why should I have to switch just because you thought it was a good idea to \"experiment\" with the recipe!!",

The quality ingredients have been diluted, it no longer has an aroma and barely tastes of anything. Coupled with the addition of black dusty 'floor sweepings'? which do nothing to add flavour and only leave a dirty residue at the bottom of the cup. The drink has now become unpleasant. Marketing it as 'more Barista' is a nonsense. Your consumers are not that stupid! We will not be buying any more, or recommending it to people.",

The black gritty bits are terrible left in the bottom of the cup, I don't want my  coffee to taste like filter or barista made . It is now bitter tasting.\r\n I also have a friend who has now started buying a different make. \r\nSuch a shame as I really did like the old recipe.\r\nI did send an email to  ask why it has been changed and just got a  stock answer.\r\nPlease change the coffee back to the old recipe.",

On opening the new jar there was no fresh aroma and even more disappointing no full flavour - the taste we have experienced for many years is no longer there and the worst thing is the bitter grit & sludge left at the bottom of the cup! We might as well drink fresh ground coffee all day and enjoy the flavour than drink this newly revamped version! I'm afraid yours will be staying in the jar and we will be shopping for an alternative which gives us the flavour we want from an instant product not a 'barista made experience' Why change a customer favourite to this inferior product that is no longer a well rounded SMOOTH coffee?",

I have drunk Gold Blend for ever as the taste was far superior to other instant coffees alas no more.  This product is bitter and weak on taste nothing like the previous delicious coffee.  Unfortunately I have two further jars of this awful product which I will have to throw away as I do not find this coffee palatable it leaves an awful after taste.  Why on earth change a product that was successful and popular.  I was prepared to pay a premium price but not for this inferior product.  I will not be buying your products in future unless you revert back to the original product.",
